# Technical indicators example implementations

This project contains examples on how to implement certain technical indicator formulas in Rust code. The indicators are: Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands (BOLL), and Relative Strength Index (RSI).

The project also downloads historical coin price data for BTC and USDT from the Binance API to use with these technical indicators.

I have a blog post explaining the writing of the code for this project: (How to: technical indicators with Rust and Binance)[https://tms-dev-blog.com/how-to-technical-indicators-with-rust-and-binance/]
